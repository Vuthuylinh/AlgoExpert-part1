There is an algorithms tournament taking plae in which teams of programmers compete against each other to solve algorithmic problems as fast as possible. Teams compete in a round robin, where each team face off against all of other teams. Only two teams compete agains each other at a time, and for each competition, one team is designated the home team, while other team is the away team. In each compettition, there's always one winner and one loser; there are no ties. A team receives 3 points if it wins and 0 point if it loses. The winner of the tournament is the team that receive the most amount of points.
Given an array of pairs representing the teams that have competeed against each other and an array containing the results of eachs compettition, write a function that returns the winner of the tournament. the input arrays are named `compettitions` and `results`, respectively. The `compettitions` array has elements in the form of `[homeTeam,awayTeam]`, where each team is a string of at most 30 characters representing the name of the team. The results array contains information aboout the winner of each correspondig compettition tin the `compettitions` array. Specifically, `results[i]` demotes the winner of `compettition[i]`, where a `1` in the `results` array means that the home team in the corresponding compettition won, and `0` means that away team won.
