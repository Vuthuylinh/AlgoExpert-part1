# Find Closest value in BST

## Promt
 Write a function that takes in a Binary Search tree (BST) and a target integer value and returns the closet value to that target value contained in the BST.
 You can assume that there will only be one closet value.
 Eac BST node has an integer value, a left child node and a right child node. A nde is said to be valid BSR node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; it value is less or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or None/Null
