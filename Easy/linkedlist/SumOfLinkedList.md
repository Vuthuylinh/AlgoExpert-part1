You are given two Linked List of potentially unequal length. Each Linked List represenrs a non-negative integer, where each node in the LinkedList is a digit of the integer. Write a function that returns the head of a new Linked List that represents the sum of the integers represented by the two input Linked Lists.
Each `LinkedList` node has an integer value as well as a next node pointing to the next node in the list or to Null/None if it's the tail of the list. The value of each `LinkedList` node is always in the rang od `0 - 9`.
Note: your function must create and return a new LinkedList and you are not allowed to modify either of the input LinkedLists.
